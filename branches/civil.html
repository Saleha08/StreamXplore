            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Civil Engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment. This includes works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, and structural components of buildings.</p>
            <p>Civil engineers shape the world we live in, creating infrastructure that supports modern civilization while addressing challenges like urbanization, population growth, and sustainability. They combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving to develop solutions that are safe, efficient, and environmentally conscious.</p>
